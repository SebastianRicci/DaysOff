# DaysOff

Welcome to the Daysoff project! This project aims to help employees make the most of their paid time off (PTO) days by creating a vacation schedule that takes into account local bank holidays.

## Features

- Input your PTO days and the location where you live.
- Our algorithm will take into account local bank holidays and suggest the best possible vacation schedule.
- The suggested schedule will maximize the number of consecutive days off, so you can take longer, more enjoyable trips.
- Export your suggested schedule into Google calendar.

## Usage

To use DaysOff, follow these steps:

1. Download and install the project on your device.
2. Open the project and input your PTO days and location.
3. View the suggested vacation schedule and make any necessary adjustments.
4. Save the schedule and start planning your trips!
